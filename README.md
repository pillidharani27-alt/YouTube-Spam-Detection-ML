YouTube Spam Comment Detection using Machine Learning

A complete Machine Learning & NLP-based system to automatically detect spam comments on YouTube, using advanced text preprocessing, multiple ML algorithms, and a Flask web app for real-time prediction.

This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, deployment, UI integration, and MySQL connectivity, making it a full end-to-end ML application.

🚀 Project Overview

YouTube receives millions of comments daily, many of which are spam, scam, promotional, or harmful.
This project uses Machine Learning + NLP to classify comments as:

Spam

Not Spam

The system is trained using multiple ML algorithms and deployed using a Flask Web Application, where users can input any comment and instantly see prediction results.
